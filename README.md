# Delta Math Pseudocode Transpiler

This is a basic Typescript transpiler for the pseudocode that is created by https://www.deltamath.com/

This was created in 8 hours starting with minimal knowledge of how to create a language. This project is in desperate need of refactoring and could use some reworking to be more efficient. If I have the time for it I might refactor and rework some of it but at the moment all the code works.

## Features

- Basic Math (Does not do order of operations)
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Logging
- Random Number Generation

## Example
